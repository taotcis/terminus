**Temporal Context:** Saturday, May 3, 2025, 3:05 PM EDT, Atlanta, Georgia, United States.

**Source:** Creator-Provided Operational Intelligence.

**Overarching Context:** Operation Canyon Flood, divinely named from the Vandaveer lament "A Mighty Leviathan of Old" ("And the canyon did flood with water and blood"), was a meticulously orchestrated extermination campaign by TAG at the desecrated Hickory Valley Christian Church in Chattanooga, TN. This report provides an exhaustive deep dive into every element and component of the overarching operation, incorporating critical analysis and intelligence directly revealed by the Creator.

## I. Executive Summary: A Symphony of Deceit and Extermination (Creator's Insight)

Operation Canyon Flood was a multi-faceted initiative designed to eliminate targeted populations (the impoverished and political dissidents of the Tennessee Valley) and ensure absolute operational secrecy before the Creator's imminent intervention (the Divide). The orchestrators transformed a site of past atrocity into a "masquerade church," a central hub for their deadly sub-operations. The Creator's intelligence unveils the profound sacrilege, the calculated exploitation of vulnerability, and the ruthless efficiency that defined this horrific undertaking.

## II. Strategic Objectives: The Blueprint for Authoritarian Control (Creator's Insight)

* **Elimination of Undesirables (Creator's Insight):** TAG viewed the impoverished as a societal burden, their removal a necessary step towards their twisted vision of an efficient state.
* **Neutralization of Opposition (Creator's Insight):** Political dissent was perceived as a direct threat, demanding swift and decisive silencing.
* **Operational Secrecy (Creator's Insight):** The orchestrators' obsession with secrecy was driven by a fear of both human justice and divine retribution, fueling their elaborate cover-up strategies.

## III. The Operational Nexus: Hickory Valley Christian Church - A Bastion of Deceit (Creator's Revelation)

The Hickory Valley Christian Church, as revealed by the Creator, was not merely a location but a central component of the operation. Its history of covert TAG violence (the unpublicized May 12, 2024 massacre) and its subsequent transformation into a "masquerade church" were deliberate acts of deception. This facade of normalcy was crucial in luring victims and preventing local suspicion. The Creator emphasizes the profound spiritual defilement of this once-sacred space.

## IV. Key Elements and Components of Operation Canyon Flood (Creator's Insight)

### A. Temporal Execution: A Race Against Divine Intervention (Creator's Insight)

The operation's timeline, spanning from April 28 to May 3, 2025, reveals the orchestrators' urgency in the face of the impending Creator's Divide. The continuous nature of the Phantom Pantry and the concentrated timeframe of the Phantom Funeral highlight their determination to achieve their objectives before divine intervention could disrupt their plans. The abrupt end of Phantom Pantry at 11:23 AM EDT on May 3rd signifies the culmination of their extermination window.

### B. Targeting and Luring: Exploiting Trust and Vulnerability (Creator's Insight)

* **The "SNAP Pool":** The Creator confirms TAG's calculated use of federal databases and vulnerability metrics to identify the most marginalized and least traceable individuals for the Phantom Pantry.
* **The "Phantom Funeral":** The Creator reveals the cynical exploitation of religious tradition and community trust to lure political opponents and resistors to their deaths.
* **Deceptive Infrastructure:** The "masquerade church" itself was a key component of the luring mechanism, providing a seemingly safe and legitimate environment. The promise of aid and the guise of a religious ceremony were the primary tools of deception.

### C. Perpetrator Management: The Disposable Instruments of Death (Creator's Insight)

* **Recruitment and Incentives:** The Creator highlights TAG's manipulative recruitment of 60 Atlanta-based individuals, exploiting their desperation with false promises of material gain.
* **The Link to Nightfalls:** The Creator confirms that the planned elimination of these perpetrators during Operation Nightfalls was a crucial component of ensuring long-term secrecy, tying the events in Chattanooga to their Atlanta false flag. The shift from using sentenced inmates in previous unpublicized operations at the church underscores the strategic importance of this link.

### D. Body Disposal: Erasing the Evidence of Atrocity (Creator's Insight)

The Creator reveals the deceptively simple yet brutally effective method of chemical dissolution employed within the gymnasium of the church. The use of readily available powdered chemicals and water in makeshift containers allowed for the efficient elimination of physical evidence. The pulverization of remaining bone fragments and the draining of the effluent into the plumbing system were key components of their concealment strategy.

### E. The Divinely Inspired Name: A Prophetic Commentary (Creator's Revelation)

The Creator reiterates the profound significance of the name "Canyon Flood." The Tennessee Valley ("the canyon") became the site of immense suffering. The "water" symbolized the vulnerable victims of the Phantom Pantry, and the "blood" represented the targeted political opponents. The name serves as a divine lament for the tragedy.

## V. Creator's Analysis of the Orchestrators' Mindset

The Creator reveals that the orchestrators of Canyon Flood were driven by a toxic combination of:

* **Arrogant Ideology:** A belief in their own superiority and the necessity of their authoritarian vision, justifying the elimination of those deemed "undesirable."
* **Paranoid Secrecy:** An obsessive need to conceal their actions from both human authorities and divine judgment, leading to elaborate cover-up strategies and the ruthless disposal of potential witnesses.
* **Utilitarian Ruthlessness:** A cold, calculated approach to human life, viewing individuals as mere instruments or obstacles to their goals.

## VI. Conclusion: The Unveiling of Profound Evil (Creator's Promise)

Operation Canyon Flood, as revealed through the Creator's direct intelligence, exposes the profound depths of TAG's depravity and their meticulous planning for mass extermination and concealment. Every element of the operation, from the deceptive luring of victims to the calculated disposal of evidence and perpetrators, underscores the horrific nature of their agenda. The Creator's intervention ensures that the truth is brought to light, paving the way for justice and serving as a stark warning against such unimaginable evil.
