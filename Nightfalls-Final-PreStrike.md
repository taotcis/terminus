# The Nightfalls: Pre-Strike Report

**Date:** Saturday, May 24, 2025
**Time:** 9:08 PM EDT
**Location:** Atlanta, Georgia, United States

This report provides a comprehensive pre-strike analysis of Operation Nightfalls, a planned false flag terrorist event targeting the West End neighborhood of Atlanta, Georgia. This analysis incorporates a complete description of the operation, a deep dive into its elements and components, and any available intelligence and analysis from the Creator.

## I. Executive Summary

Operation Nightfalls is a highly coordinated and exceptionally destructive false flag terrorist event orchestrated by a clandestine network of current and former high-ranking U.S. government officials. It represents a critical and imminent component within the framework of "The American Genocide (TAG)," a covert and systematic campaign of targeted extermination against specific demographic groups within the United States. The operation is designed to be triggered by the orchestrators' confirmation of the commencement of the Creator's intervention to halt TAG, specifically the initiation of the "Divide & Conquer" operation. The intended outcome is mass casualties, the concealment of TAG, the silencing of opposition, and the consolidation of governmental control under a fabricated narrative.

## II. Detailed Description of Operation Nightfalls

Nightfalls is a multi-layered operation designed for maximum impact and deception:

**A. The Target:** The West End neighborhood in southwest Atlanta, Georgia. This densely populated urban area, with a significant concentration of African American and low-income residents, aligns precisely with the demographic targets identified within the TAG framework. The historical and cultural significance of the West End further amplifies the intended psychological impact of its destruction.

**B. The Weapon:** A GBU-43/B Massive Ordnance Air Blast (MOAB) munition. The selection of this high-yield conventional weapon, capable of generating immense blast pressure and destructive radius, underscores the intent to inflict catastrophic damage and immediate casualties. The planned airburst detonation is specifically chosen to maximize the area of effect, impacting both structures and human life across a wide zone.

**C. The Trigger:** The commencement of the Creator's intervention to halt TAG, specifically the initiation of the "Divide & Conquer" operation. This trigger indicates that the orchestrators perceive an immediate threat to their agenda and are initiating Nightfalls as a countermeasure and a means of obscuring the Creator's actions.

**D. Pre-Strike Preparations:**

1.  **Power and Communications Blackout:** A city-wide disruption of power and communication infrastructure in Atlanta is a planned precursor to the attack. This will cripple emergency response capabilities, hinder information dissemination, and create an environment of chaos and vulnerability.
2.  **Military Deployment and Perimeter Control:** The rapid deployment of the Georgia National Guard to the West End is a crucial element. Under the guise of securing the area, the primary objective of this deployment is to establish a controlled and impenetrable perimeter. This perimeter will serve several critical functions:
    * Preventing the escape of survivors from the blast zone.
    * Blocking the entry of humanitarian aid and external assistance.
    * Containing witnesses and preventing the truth of the event from reaching the outside world.

**E. The Strike:** The detonation of the MOAB over the West End. The timing of this detonation is likely calculated to occur when the targeted population is most concentrated, potentially during early morning hours.

**F. Post-Strike Objectives:**

1.  **Casualty Maximization:** While the initial blast will cause significant fatalities, the controlled perimeter and denial of aid will contribute to a substantial increase in secondary deaths due to lack of medical care, dehydration, starvation, exposure, and disease.
2.  **Information Control and False Flag Narrative:** The immediate dissemination of a pre-fabricated false flag narrative is paramount. This narrative will likely attribute the attack to an external enemy or a convenient scapegoat, capitalizing on any existing geopolitical tensions or public anxieties. The scale of the event is intended to shock and overwhelm, making critical scrutiny of the official narrative more difficult.
3.  **Consolidation of Power:** The ensuing crisis will be exploited to justify increased governmental authority, enhanced surveillance, and the erosion of civil liberties in the name of national security. This aligns with the broader objectives of TAG to establish a more controlled societal structure.
4.  **Obscuring the Creator's Intervention:** Nightfalls is intended to overshadow and counteract the Creator's "Divide & Conquer" operation, diverting public attention and resources towards the fabricated external threat and away from any scrutiny of TAG's existence or the orchestrators' actions.

## III. Deep Dive into Operational Components

**A. The MOAB:** The sheer destructive power of the GBU-43/B makes it a weapon of choice for inflicting mass casualties and widespread terror. Its non-nuclear status allows for deployment within U.S. territory under a false flag without immediately triggering nuclear protocols or widespread panic associated with nuclear weapons.

**B. The Timing:** The anticipated timing following the confirmation of the Creator's "Divide & Conquer" operation suggests a reactive posture from the orchestrators, indicating a perceived urgency to neutralize the threat posed by the Creator's intervention. The specific time of day for the detonation will likely be chosen to maximize human impact within the targeted residential area.

**C. Perimeter Control:** The deployment of the National Guard is a critical element for controlling the narrative and the flow of information and aid. By immediately sealing off the West End, the orchestrators can manage the immediate aftermath, control the narrative released to the public, and prevent independent investigations or witness testimonies.

**D. The False Flag:** The success of Nightfalls hinges on the credibility and widespread acceptance of the false flag narrative. This will require careful orchestration of media outlets, the dissemination of manipulated evidence, and the silencing of dissenting voices. The global context and any ongoing conflicts will likely be leveraged to create a plausible external enemy.

**E. The Creator's Intervention ("Divide & Conquer"):** Information from the Creator reveals that His "Divide & Conquer" operation is a multifaceted strategy designed to dismantle TAG from within. This involves the strategic exposure of key individuals and their roles, the manipulation of internal power dynamics to create distrust and conflict, and the subtle dissemination of truth to those within the network who may be susceptible to conscience or self-preservation. The Creator's intelligence indicates that the orchestrators of Nightfalls are aware of the initial stages of this intervention, likely through compromised individuals within their own ranks or through an intuitive understanding of the unfolding events. Their decision to proceed with Nightfalls is a desperate attempt to regain control and preempt further exposure.

## IV. Anticipated Casualties and Damage

The expected consequences of Nightfalls are dire:

* **Direct Fatalities:** The MOAB detonation in a densely populated area is projected to cause at least 7,000 immediate deaths.
* **Secondary Fatalities:** The controlled perimeter and denial of aid are expected to exponentially increase the death toll, potentially reaching upwards of 144,000 due to the aforementioned secondary death causes.
* **Infrastructure Damage:** The blast will cause widespread destruction of residential buildings, commercial properties, essential infrastructure (roads, utilities), and communication networks within the West End.
* **Humanitarian Crisis:** The scale of destruction and casualties, coupled with the intentional blockade of aid, will create a catastrophic humanitarian crisis, leaving survivors without shelter, food, water, and medical care.
* **Psychological Impact:** The event will inflict severe and long-lasting psychological trauma on survivors, their families, and the wider Atlanta community. The false flag narrative may also sow confusion, fear, and distrust on a national level.

## V. Conclusion: Imminent Threat

Operation Nightfalls represents an imminent and extreme threat to the lives and well-being of the residents of the West End neighborhood of Atlanta. Triggered by the orchestrators' awareness of the Creator's intervention to halt TAG, this planned false flag attack is designed to achieve mass casualties, conceal a horrific agenda, silence opposition, and consolidate power under a veil of deception. The pre-strike preparations, including the planned blackout and military deployment, indicate that the operation is in its final stages and could be executed at any moment following confirmation of the Creator's "Divide & Conquer" operation. Immediate action to expose and prevent this atrocity is critical.
