# Terminus: Last words, first words

## Preface
At the foundation of these revelations stands the Creator—revered globally across cultures, is the One who desired to create life and, therefore, had to create the universe to support it. He is the Alpha and the Omega, and the Great “I Am.” These titles emphasize His role in both creating and sustaining all existence. The Creator is also known by various names such as Allah, God, Jehovah, and Yahweh in monotheistic faiths. His attributes of omnipresence, omnipotence, and omnibenevolence are universally acknowledged. His two servants neutrally refer to Him as "the Creator," in accordance with His directive to respect diverse religious beliefs. This inclusive name transcends faith boundaries, embraced by believers, non-believers, and even atheists.

This document provides a detailed analysis of the literal fulfillment of Revelation 11. It establishes that the Book of Revelation chronicles the Creator’s direct intervention into The American Genocide, along with its prelude, The Campaign to Suffocate Spark—a divine gift bestowed for the benefit of all humanity. It further contends that prior interpretations of this prophecy, which is reflected across a broad spectrum of religious traditions and belief systems beyond Christianity, have been fundamentally limited by a misaligned foundational premise. As a result, previous understandings failed to recognize the true scope, context, and application of the events now unfolding.

Additionally, this document examines the concept of Jacobsen’s Ladder as detailed within Revelation 11. Jacobsen’s Ladder refers to the human male genitalia when it has been physically deviated from its original, natural form as a consequence of actions directed by an individual’s subconscious mind. Beyond its biological reference, Jacobsen’s Ladder also denotes a conceptual framework which exploits this altered condition as the basis for a flawed litmus test used to further the objectives of the genocide. The term is named after "Hurricane Annie," Annie Jacobsen, a senior CIA operative who oversaw operations that targeted seated congregations during worship services, systematically eliminating all individuals present. Subsequently, the vacated church properties were repurposed as strategic sites for additional mass execution operations.

The litmus test embedded within the Jacobsen’s Ladder framework was specifically designed to serve as an indicator of either the start of the Creator’s intervention to halt The American Genocide (TAG) or the imminent onset of such intervention. A "clear" result—signifying either no divine intervention or an acceptable delay—was considered by the orchestrators as validation that they could proceed with further orchestrations. The engineering of such a "clear" result was essential to obtaining the internal authorization or "Go Ahead" for Nightfalls, a covert operation conducted in southwest Atlanta intended to escalate the broader genocide agenda.

## Introduction
### The American Genocide 
The American Genocide (TAG) is a chilling reality: an ongoing and hidden covert and systematic campaign of extermination orchestrated by:

1.  President Donald J. Trump
2.  Senior CIA Operative Annie Jacobsen ("Hurricane Annie")
3.  Senior CIA Operative Michael Blackmon
4.  President Joe Biden
5.  Former Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA)
6.  Senator Mitch McConnell (R-KY)
7.  CIA Director William Burns

This operation, backed by the White House and various government entities, aims to establish an authoritarian regime. TAG targets and eliminates specific groups of people within the United States. The Creator views each of the people who’ve lost their lives as a martyr.

The motives behind TAG include the desire to consolidate power, suppress opposition, and eliminate those considered undesirable by the orchestrators.

The groups targeted in TAG include:

* **American Christians (all races):** Christians are targeted because their faith, moral resistance, and unwillingness to submit make them an obstacle to the orchestrators' aspirations of absolute power and authoritarian rule.
    * Reasons why Christians would oppose an authoritarian regime or not support it:
        * Christians often prioritize their allegiance to God and their faith's teachings, which may conflict with the demands of an authoritarian regime.
        * Christian values emphasize individual conscience, moral responsibility, and the importance of justice, which can lead to resistance against oppressive rule.
        * Historically, Christians have opposed authoritarian regimes that seek to suppress religious freedom or impose state ideologies.
* **African-Americans:** Considered undesirable by the orchestrators.
* **The impoverished:** Considered undesirable by the orchestrators.

The methods employed in TAG are brutal and systematic, encompassing targeted killings, mass executions, and deceptive operations designed to lure and eliminate victims. A particularly sinister hallmark of The American Genocide is the orchestration of events designed for mass extermination, unique in their conception and execution. **Congregation massacres, Phantom Funerals, and Phantom Pantries are all orchestrations (mass executions) unique to The American Genocide.** The lives lost will illustrate the death toll and the activities of the orchestrators, and empower members of the general public to bring it to a halt. The Creator never included death in His creation's design, although death can and does happen; every single death is significant for Him.

The Congregation Massacres, a chilling chapter in TAG, involve covert, high-intensity operations targeting church congregations during their weekly worship services. In each case, the massacres involved the systematic execution of every individual present, with no one left to tell the tale. These operations were meticulously planned and carried out by operatives under the direction of Annie Jacobsen, known as *“Hurricane Annie.”*

On April 2, 2023, during Sunday worship at Mount Calvary Baptist Church in Lexington, Kentucky, one such massacre unfolded. Armed forces stormed the sanctuary, blocking exits and covering windows. Congregants attempting to flee were gunned down. Those who called 911 unknowingly spoke to fake dispatchers who falsely assured them help was on the way. The attack escalated into brutal assault, rape, and systematic execution. Victims were beheaded with chainsaws at the piano and organ, forced to witness the slaughter of their loved ones before meeting the same fate. The Creator, the very one they had gathered to worship, heard their cries – the cries of doves.

The details of the church assaults include:

* **Mount Calvary Baptist Church**, Lexington, KY; predominantly African American; 127 victims. This was the lifelong church of one of the Creator's two servants, though they had not been a regular attendee in recent years and were not present on April 2, 2023.
* **Lexington Bethel Baptist Church**, Lexington, KY; predominantly Caucasian; 250 victims.
* **House of God (Georgetown Street)**, Lexington, KY; predominantly African American; 300 victims.
* **House of God (Broadway)**, Lexington, KY; predominantly African American; 300 victims.
* **Mount Zion Baptist Church**, Georgetown, KY; predominantly African American; 166 victims.
* **Calvary Baptist Church**, Lexington, KY; predominantly Caucasian; 400 victims.
* **Hickory Valley Christian Church**, Chattanooga, TN; predominantly Caucasian; 1000 victims. This church operated a private school, Hamilton Heights Christian Academy, where one of the Creator's two servants had donated his professional expertise and time upgrading their computer lab at the request of a friend. Retired Pastor Duke Stone, who was also the principal of the school, was told by the Creator's servant of the massacre at his church and others and urged them to take precautions during their worship services.

These massacres were executed with terrifying efficiency. Armed operatives stormed sanctuaries during the most vulnerable moments—weekly worship services—blockading exits and systematically executing all attendees. Those who attempted to flee were swiftly neutralized. The perpetrators, under the direction of Jacobsen, utilized prescribed methods of execution: in some instances, beheading was employed to ensure swift, silent, and efficient killing; in other massacres, firing squads eliminated the congregations. In the aftermath, the bodies were disposed of with chilling thoroughness, through a chemical dissolution method designed to leave no trace of the victims behind. Jacobsen also implemented a strategic deception campaign, using mobile cell towers to reroute emergency calls and make it appear as if help was on the way, when in reality, no local authorities were ever contacted or dispatched.

The Creator foretold of these events in prophecy and through the arts, including *"Sign o' the Times"* and *"When the Doves Cry"* by Prince. The 1987 hit song *“Sign of the Times”* by Prince prophetically predicted Jacobsen’s involvement in these horrific events. The song’s haunting lyrics include the line: *“Hurricane Annie ripped the ceiling off a church and killed everyone inside.”* This lyric eerily foretells Jacobsen’s future actions in carrying out the mass executions inside sanctuaries in Central Kentucky and Chattanooga, Tennessee, cementing her place as the figurehead of these atrocities.

Prince’s song *“When Doves Cry,”* though often interpreted as a song about lost love and emotional turmoil, carries a far more profound and prophetic meaning. It serves as a divine lament for the brutal massacre at Mount Calvary Baptist Church, any of the six other churches that followed, or the orchestrations carried out in TAG that used the properties of the seven churches as the site of a mass execution. The lyrics poignantly capture the terror of the congregants as they desperately tried to flee, not just physically but also mentally, by imagining peaceful scenes. The “animals” in the lyrics represent the merciless operatives, while the agonizing questions reflect the victims’ disbelief at being forsaken. The chilling command, *"Don't make me chase you,"* echoes the operatives chasing terrified children through the sanctuary as they desperately tried to escape their execution. Ultimately, the “cries” in the song symbolize the sound of innocent lives being extinguished as chainsaws roared through the sanctuary. Prince, unknowingly divinely inspired, transcribed this horrific tragedy decades before it occurred, creating an unspoken memorial to the victims of these atrocities, regardless of which church property became their final resting place.

In the aftermath of the church attacks, surviving members of the congregation were hunted down and individually executed. The properties of the targeted churches were repurposed into masquerade churches to facilitate further mass executions. These masquerade churches were used in operations such as:

* **Fake Funerals (Phantom Funerals):** Bogus memorial services lured in grieving mourners who were then eliminated.
* **Fake Charitable Services (Phantom Pantries):** False offers of aid, like food pantries, were used to systematically lure and eliminate the impoverished.

The orchestrators of TAG implement elaborate cover-up measures to conceal their actions, including the chemical dissolution of bodies, identity theft, digital deception, the silencing of those who suspect the truth, and the suppression of investigations.

TAG meets the United Nations definition of genocide. Through systematic killings, mental harm, sterilizations, and the destruction of communities, TAG’s orchestrators aim to eradicate entire groups.

The Creator has deemed it necessary to make a rare intervention into human affairs to bring TAG to a halt.

> "The American Genocide is an active and hidden genocide that has the full support of the White House, some in congressional leadership, and is occurring entirely within the borders of one of the planet's last superpowers. It would be worse than the Holocaust; there are no Allied Forces coming because any country that would make up a part of a new Allied Forces can't imagine such a thing possible in the United States.” - the Creator.
